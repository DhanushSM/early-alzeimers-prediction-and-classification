Got it 👍 Since your repo already has **app.py** (backend), **index.html** (frontend), and result pages (2D, 3D visualizations), the README should also highlight the **web application aspect**, not just the ML pipeline. Here’s an improved version tailored to your repository structure:

---

# 🧠 Early Alzheimer's Prediction and Classification

This repository provides a **machine learning–powered web application** for predicting and classifying **early Alzheimer’s disease** using clinical and imaging data. The system combines **data preprocessing, model training, and interactive visualization** to help in the early detection of Alzheimer’s.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
This project implements an **end-to-end workflow**:

* Preprocessing patient data
* Training and evaluating ML/DL models
* Visualizing predictions (2D & 3D results)
* Providing a simple **web interface** for real-time testing

---

## ✨ Features

* ⚙️ **Backend:** Flask-powered API (`app.py`)
* 🧮 **ML Models:** Implemented in `model.py`
* 🌐 **Frontend UI:** Interactive HTML templates (`index.html`, `results.html`, `results_2d.html`, `results_3d.html`)
* 📊 **Visualization:** 2D & 3D classification results
* 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Flask
* scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on model.py)
* Other libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhanushSM/early-alzeimers-prediction-and-classification.git
cd early-alzeimers-prediction-and-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start locally at:
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

---

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Upload or enter patient data.
3. View prediction results in tabular, 2D, or 3D visualization formats.

✨ This version makes it clear that your repo isn’t just ML code — it’s a **full-fledged ML web app**.

Do you want me to also **add a “Demo” section** with screenshots/gifs (index.html + results pages) so that recruiters and collaborators immediately see how it works?
